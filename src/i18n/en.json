I have been caring for my mother since 2012, which taught me resilience, empathy, and discipline. I have built projects like EcoVoz, EducaCristão GPT, Control Finance, Post-it Share App, and Fullstack Toybox — all with a dose of creativity, real impact, and collaboration. My career transition came from the HR/Payroll field, where I worked for over 10 years, bringing my process, organization, and empathy experience to the tech universe. In software development, I found my purpose: to create inclusive technology, transform ideas into code, and connect people. I've participated in hackathons, dev marathons, completed bootcamps at Kenzie, Rocketseat, and courses at Alura. My profile is one of continuous learning and adaptation – I enjoy challenges, learning, and sharing what I know.",
