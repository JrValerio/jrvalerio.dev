    "title": "About Me",
    "body": "I'm Amaro Júnior (JrValerio), a Full Stack developer passionate about creating solutions that combine technology, purpose, and accessibility. I've been taking care of my mother since 2012, which taught me resilience, empathy, and discipline. I've built projects like EcoVoz, EducaCristão GPT, Control Finance, Post-it Share App, and Fullstack Toybox — all with a dose of creativity, real impact, and collaboration. My career transition came from the Personnel Department area, where I worked for over 10 years, bringing my experience in processes, organization, and empathy to the tech universe. In development, I found my purpose: to create inclusive technology, turn ideas into code, and connect people. I have participated in hackathons, dev marathons, completed bootcamps at Kenzie and Rocketseat, and taken courses at Alura. My profile is continuous learning and adaptation – I enjoy challenges, learning, and sharing what I know.",
